This would be similar to the OpenAI tag game, where agents would be trained to interact with and pursue rewards in a 3D space. There would be some primary objective that a multi-agent system would need to collaborate on to achieve. A lighthearted example would be something like Minecraft, where success/survival involves producing food, shelter, resources, and so on over an extended number of in-game days. A more important real-world example could be pedestrian or motor traffic."

","A tentative road map but essentially he project aims to enhance retrieval performance in large tabular data lakes by combining Knowledge Graphs with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework. It will focus on accurately identifying the top-k most relevant tables based on a user query and constructing an optimized JOIN query (Or any data retrieval query). We will use the relationships between tables encoded in Knowledge Graphs, our project idea will aim to improve the precision and efficiency of table selection, resulting in faster and more accurate data retrieval."
